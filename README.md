# keyedarchivelib

Basic Python (>=3.6) library to generate and parse NSKeyedArchive files.

## Installation

Install with pip:

`pip3 install keyedarchivelib`

## Usage

The `keyedarchivelib` module has the same interface as the `plistlib` standard library module:

`load`, `loads`, `dump`, and `dumps` have the same function signatures as
[plistlib](https://docs.python.org/3/library/plistlib.html) minus the `fmt` option, which is not available since it's
always binary.

The `keyedarchivelib` module includes type hints.

For convenience, examples are provided below:

### Reading (`load` & `loads`)

```python
from keyedarchivelib import load

with open("example.plist", 'rb') as fp:
    pl = load(fp)
print(pl["test"])
```

### Writing (`dump` & `dumps`)

```python
from keyedarchivelib import dump, dumps

example_dict = {
    "test": 1
}
with open("example.plist", 'wb') as fp:
    dump(example_dict, fp)

# ~~~ OR ~~~

print(dumps(example_dict))
```

## Note on compatibility

For versions below 3.8, `plistlib` doesn't support all the plist features used by NSKeyedArchiver. A compatibility
hot-patching layer is used to support these lesser versions of Python. This library has not endured thorough testing
beyond the latest versions of Python 3.6, 3.7, and 3.8. Please open issues for any observed problems!
